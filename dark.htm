            The dark web first officially appeared in the early 2000s along with the creation of Freenet, which was developed
             by Ian Clarke to secure users against government intervention and cyber attacks. The system, which is still available
              today, allows users to express themselves freely without being tracked online.
              The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory funded a project called The Onion Router (TOR). TOR offered intelligence sources a way to communicate easily and safely,
               especially in hostile areas where personal safety is key. It is now one of the most common browsers used to access the dark web, using databases to help people
                make their way around and find the information they need.
                <br>
                
Ross Ulbricht was invested and arrested in 2013 for creating and running the dark web site The Silk Road, a darknet website authorities said was used to buy and sell narcotics.
                This constitutes approximately 5-6% of the web.

            The rise of cryptocurrencies increased the popularity of the dark web, especially for cybercriminals. That's because digital currencies often provide a great deal
                 of anonymity for people who buy and sell on the dark web.Because of its association with certain illicit activities, there have been calls for regulation of the dark web.
                  For instance, the G20 and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) have both called for cryptocurrency companies to provide information on buyers and sellers in transactions conducted online.
                  This is especially true, they say, to help law enforcement track criminal organizations and illicit activities.

            As you surf, you'll probably notice that dark website addresses end with the .onion extension rather than the traditional .com, .org, .edu, etc. One word of warning, though. 
            Make sure you have some security software installed because there's a good chance that you may come in contact with malware and phishing scams.

    You can access the dark web by installing specific, anonymous browsers, such as TOR. Once installed, the browser works the same way traditional ones do. 
    But it can be a little difficult to access information because it doesn't use an index to locate the desired information.
     Make sure that you install security software to make sure your computer and personal information are kept safe.

         <img src="tor.jpg" alt="alt" height="50%" width="50%"><br><br>
        Despite its current usage as a browser that is often used to access parts of the Dark Web, TOR (aka. the Dark Web browser) was originally developed to help safeguard US Intelligence online communications.

Today, it is one of the few ways to access .onion websites, which are located on the Dark Web.

TOR is a variant of the popular Firefox web browser, modified to allow users to browse the web anonymously. The browser is designed to block or advise against user attempts to do things that might reveal their identity, such as resizing the dimensions of the browser window, for example.
Make sure the tor browser is up to date before accessing the dark web because if it is not updated, some of the additional/normal security features may be compromised. This is one of the key things to keep in mind while accessing the dark web.

        DuckDuckGo (DDG) is an internet search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers' privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of personalized search results.
        DuckDuckGo does not show search results from content farms.
        It uses various APIs of other websites to show quick results to queries and for traditional links it
        uses the help of its partners (mainly Bing) and its own crawler.(A web crawler, or spider, is a type of bot that is typically operated by search engines. 
        Their purpose is to index the content of websites all across the Internet so that those websites can appear in search engine results.)

         <img src="bridges.jpg" alt="alt"><br><br>
        Tor bridges are secret Tor relays that keep your connection to the Tor network hidden. Use a bridge as your first Tor relay
        if connecting to Tor is blocked or if using Tor could look suspicious to someone who monitors your Internet connection.
        The Obfs4 Bridge client takes the Tor-encrypted payload and seals it up with the Obfs4 function. The sealed packets are then sent to the Obfs4 Bridge relay. 
        Unsealing them, the Bridge relay gets the Tor encrypted packets and forwards them to the next Tor relay of the Tor circuit.
        To get bridges, please visit the link below and follow the instruction :-

        If your personal information such as your email address is spotted on the dark web, it likely means that you have been affected by a data breach. Finding yourself in such a situation is not normal.
        Hence, usage of temporary email-ids on the dark web is very much preferred as we can generate them with no personal information and we can later dispose them after usage.
        This is a very basic thing that we follow while using the dark web.

           purchases on dark markets.

        The use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is highly recommended – they help to protect your online privacy, keep your identity
        safe and protect all data that’s being sent to and from your device. But make sure the VPN you’re using meets a few basic criteria.

You will want to choose one which is based out of a country without strict data retention laws,
like NordVPN which is based in the Panama. Top quality service providers like this help assure your privacy and security well.

Best VPN for the Dark Web
When looking for a VPN for Dark Web surfing, there are certain criteria you need to be aware of:
<ol start="1" type="I">
<li>No logging policy</li>
<li>Company based outside 5/9/14-Eyes Alliance Country</li>
<li>Robust encryption</li>
<li>Payment in crypto currency</li>
