        <h5>KNOWLEDGE</h5>
        <br />
        <img src="know.jpg" width="450" height="400" class="center">
        <p>
          Knowledge – The Deep Web is a treasure-trove of information and
          knowledge. It has some of the largest virtual libraries, more than you
          can possibly fathom. The knowledge available on the Deep Web is often
          accessed by teachers, students, and researchers as it is not so
          readily available on standard search engines. Scientific data that has
          been kept hidden from the public eye can be easily found in the Deep
          Web by spending some time researching about it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below we take a look at few educational and informative dark web
          websites.
        </p>

        <br />
        <div class="“IW”">
          <h5>INFORMATIVE WEBSITES</h5>
          <img src="iw.jpg" width="450" height="400" class="center">
          <br />
          <p>
            Archive.org- A gigantic database of media that’s been entered into
            the public domain. Sound recordings, old videos, rare books, pretty
            much anything you might need to build your next great presentation
            at school, work, or both! Partnered with the Wayback Machine, which
            has over 280 billion webpages that have been indexed since nearly
            the inception of the internet itself.

            and capable of returning results from within any document you’re
            trying to search for.
          </p>

          <p>
            These are just a few of many informational websites present on the
            dark web
          </p>
        </div>
        <br />

        <h5>ANONYMITY</h5>
        <img src="2.jpg" width="450" height="400" class="center">
        <p>
          Anonymity – While some consider anonymity to be a double-edged sword,
          it should be appreciated positively as it results in freedom. Browsers
          that are used to access the Dark Web, such as Tor, are secure as they
          guarantee that your IP address remains untraceable. To make it more
          secure, always use Tor with an underlying VPN. <br />
        </p>

        <p>Here are ways to protect yourself while browsing on dark web.</p>
        <br />

        <h5>TOR</h5>
        <img src="tor.jpg" width="450" height="400" class="center">
        <br />

        <p>TOR is the most popular anonymity network exist in the dark web.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The TOR anonymity network is free, open-source software, originally
          developed by the US Navy Research Laboratory (NRL) in the mid-1990s to
          protect intelligence online communications. Later in 2004, the NRL
          released the TOR source code under a free license. TOR is now managed
          by The Tor Project, Inc, a non-profit organization that maintains TOR
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          TOR network can be used to anonymize internet user’s online identity
          when surfing the surface web, in addition to enabling access to TOR
          anonymous websites (also known as TOR hidden services). To use TOR to
          browse the surface internet anonymously, all you need to do is to
          download the TOR browser (https://www.torproject.org/download) and use
          it -as you do with your regular web browser- to surf online.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h5>VPN</h5>
        <img src="vpn.jpg" width="450" height="400" class="center">
        <p>
          Using a VPN is the best measure to stay anonymous online. With a VPN,
          your data is encrypted before it reaches your ISP. That way, your
          internet provider won’t know you’re browsing on Tor, keeping your
          identity on the Dark Web fully anonymous
        </p>
        <p>
          VPN connection also provides an additional layer of security as it
          hides your IP address by relocating your virtual location before your
          data even reaches the Tor network. Many quality providers offer
          various protection features like military-grade data encryption and
          DNS leak protection to make sure your online identity is fully
          protected as well as a kill switch option should your internet
          connection drop suddenly.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h5>FREEDOM OF SPEECH</h5>
        <img src="free.jpg" width="450" height="400" class="center">
        <p>
          Freedom of Speech – As discussed in the preceding point, freedom of
          speech is one of the most important freedoms that are a direct
          consequence of anonymity. Some countries practice the right to freely
          express your thoughts and opinion very strongly without fearing any
          form of persecution. This right still remains a utopia for most of the
          world. Dark Web allows users to freely communicate without fearing law
          enforcement or government agencies as the communication is encrypted
          and IP addresses are masked to protect their identity.

        <h3 class="cons">CONS OF DARK WEB</h3>
      
        <br />
       <div class="div1">
        <h5>DRUGS AND BANNED SUBSTANCES</h5>
        <img src="drugs.jpg" width="450" height="400" class="center">
        <p>
          Drugs and Banned Substances – The Dark Web is a safe haven for illegal
          activities related to the drug and contraband trade. One of the most
          well-known marketplaces for weapons, drugs, and other illegal stuff,
          was the Silk Road and was available on the Dark Web. As a user, you
          should be very careful while accessing the Dark Web as one can be
          easily influenced by the easy availability of such items which will
          eventually land them into trouble.
        </p>
        <br />
      

        <h5>CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</h5>
        <img src="child.jpg" width="450" height="400" class="center">
        <p>
          Child Pornography – Child pornography is rampant on the Dark Web. We
          are not proud of it but it is a reality. There are literally gigabytes
          of child porn being traded on the dark web every day. You should avoid
          such websites as it is not ethically or morally correct to be a part
          of them.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h5>MALWARE</h5>
        <img src="2.png" width="450" height="400" class="center">

        <p>
          While the Dark Web is a place for hacktivists to meet and also stop
          many digital attacks, it’s also a platform for those hackers who are
          eager to exploit vulnerable users. They create fraudulent sites on the
          Dark Web containing malware that can infect your computer. These
          malicious programs can record keystrokes, steal documents and
          financial data, record audio and video from your computer, or even
          hijack your personal device for blackmail.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h5>CRIMINAL ACTIVITY</h5>
        <img src=" crime.jpg " width="450" height="400" class="center">

        <p>
          Apart from hackers, the Dark Web is often used by many criminals to
          sell stolen goods, weapons, drugs, and fake documents (i.e.
          passports). Criminals have also been known to use the Dark Web to hire
          hackers and assassins. Some sites have disturbing and illegal content
          like child pornography or even live streamed murders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list of criminal activities taking place on the Dark Web grows
          every day and it can be difficult to filter through the unknown
          platform. I strongly advise against browsing through randomly found
          sites — that way you will avoid accessing any highly unsettling
          content.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h5>SURVEILLANCE</h5>
        <img src=" surv.jpg" width="450" height="400" class="center">

        <p>
          Law enforcement agencies and governments monitor the Dark Web to catch
          criminals. As it’s incredibly difficult to identify users on the
          Darknet, the governments usually set up fake illegal websites to catch
          cybercriminals. In some countries, you could attract the attention of
          the authorities simply by using a browser like Tor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Law enforcement regularly takes down illegal sites on the Dark Web and
          reveals the identities of the sites’ visitors. However, as long as you
          remember to abide by the lawful uses of the Darknet, you won’t have to
          worry about alerting the authorities.
        </p>

      <h5 class="bright">BRIGHT SIDE OF DARKWEB</h5>
      
      <div class=“card2”>
        <p class="card2">
          Note: Avoid attempting to access .onion sites from a surface web
          browser and proceed with caution.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="card2" >1. The Chess</h3>
        <p class="card2">
          “The Chess” is a dark website dedicated to fully anonymous games of
          chess, played in real time against a stranger. Once you create an
          account, you can participate in unlimited gaming or talk strategy in
          dedicated forums. There’s no cryptocurrency fee and the rules are
          transparent. If there were any downside, it would be that the UI of
          this website is a lot like gaming in Windows 95.
        </p>
        <h3 class="card2">2. Academic Research</h3>
        <p class="card2">
          Darknet resources such as Sci-Hub offer free access to tens of
          millions of academic papers, but these services aren’t necessarily
          legal. You’re better off sticking with surface web resources such as
          Google Scholar to avoid breaking intellectual property laws. Late last
          year, the American Journal of Freestanding Research Psychology (AJFRP)
          became the first free and open Darknet academic journal. All academic
          papers must be submitted by the original authors. It remains to be
          seen whether AJFRP will become a successful project, or even the first
          of many darknet-based academic exchanges.
        </p>
        <h3 class="card2">3. ProPublica</h3>
        <p class="card2">
          This American nonprofit news organization was the first major media
          outlet to create a dedicated presence on the darknet in 2016.
          ProPublica specializes in investigative public-interest journalism and
          was the first online-only source to ever win a Pulitzer Prize in 2010.
          The onion site offers anonymous access to individuals worldwide,
          including readers in countries where journalism is tightly censored.
        </p>
        <h3 class="card2">4.SecureDrop</h3>
        <p class="card2">
          This open-source submission system is widely used by journalists to
          anonymously communicate with sources. SecureDrop doesn’t record a
          submitter’s IP address or any browser data, simply storing the date
          and time of messages. Forbes, The New Yorker, The Washington Post and
          Vice Media are just several of many major media outlets that use
          SecureDrop. A full list of adopting media outlets is available on the
          service’s surface website. The U.S. government is also experimenting
          with SecureDrop to potentially accept anonymous vulnerability reports
          and collaborate more with white hat hackers, per CyberScoop.
        </p>
        <h3 class="card2">5. The CIA</h3>
        <p class="card2">
          Other agencies have adopted a presence on the darknet to encourage
          anonymous collaboration with sources. The U.S. Central Intelligence
          Agency (CIA) has an onion site with a “Contact Us” form. The site
          includes a promise to “carefully protect all information you provide,
          including your identity.”
        </p>
        <h3 class="card2">6. Tor Metrics</h3>
        <p class="card2">
          Tor Project Metrics has a dual presence on the surface web and
          darknet. It publishes anonymous data and analytics, providing insight
          into how the Tor browser technology is used, and by whom. Academic
          research of Tor metrics revealed that at least 60 percent of Tor’s
          usage is for legal purposes. Political censorship tops the list of why
          users download Tor for noncriminal purposes.
        </p>
        <h3 class="card2">7. IIT Tunnels</h3>
        <p class="card2">
          The Illinois Institute of Technology campus in Chicago is filled with
          secret tunnels, originally built for telecommunication access points,
          services entrances or steam vents. This elaborate underground network
          has inspired countless student pranks and even more conspiracy
          theories. One darknet user committed to fully exploring these tunnels
          and has published his findings and photos online. While there’s no
          guarantee the author didn’t break trespassing laws, this darknet site
          is pretty clean entertainment.
        </p>
        <h3 class="card2">8.Anonymous Email</h3>
        <p class="card2">
          There are several heavily encrypted email services available on the
          darknet. ProtonMail is among the best known. This end-to-end encrypted
          service was developed by MIT and CERN scientists and has a presence on
          the surface web. Like many other aspects of the darknet, fully
          anonymized email is neither good nor bad on its own. It’s neutral, and
          there are perfectly legitimate use cases. For example, one might set
          up ProtonMail to create a darknet chess account.
        </p>
        <h3 class="card2">9. Ad-Free Search</h3>
        <p class="card2">
          There are darknet search engines, but they’re mostly research projects
          that attempt to index onion sites. The majority of the deep web
          remains inaccessible through any means aside from wiki lists. Darknet
          search engines such as DuckDuckGo exist to crawl the surface web while
          protecting Tor user anonymity. You won’t find onion sites on
          DuckDuckGo, but you’ll be able to search without advertisements.
        </p>
        <h3 class="card2">10. Tor Kittenz</h3>
        <p class="card2">
          Tor Kittenz is a now-defunct Tor website that was literally just a
          slideshow of user-submitted cat pictures. The website looked like a
          1990s-style throwback, but it was a welcome respite from darker
          content on the deep web.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h5 class="dark">Is Darknet All Bad?</h5>
      
      <div class=“card2”>
        <p class="card2">
          Note: Avoid attempting to access .onion sites from a surface web
          browser and proceed with caution.
        </p>
        
        <p class="card2">
          The darknet isn’t entirely illegal activity. There are some bright spots in between criminal marketplaces and hacker forums. There are also important use cases for darknet services, such as anonymously communicating with intelligence agencies or entertainment. Similarly, the millions of Tor users worldwide doesn’t signify that the darknet has hit the mainstream. In many cases, users download Tor to avoid censorship laws or to simply protect personal data while browsing the surface web
        </p>
        <p class="card2">
          If you choose to use the dark web, always be careful.
        </p>
        <p class="card2">
        Some websites you encounter on the dark web, however, are run by criminals and can be, well, dangerous.</p>
